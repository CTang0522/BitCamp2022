# Seeing Green - BitCamp2022
## Inspiration
Going into BitCamp Christopher was excited to build his first application and upon seeing the educational hack category he felt incredibly overjoyed at the chance to educate others on the principles of Sustainability. Christopher has spent multiple semesters in Sustainability focused courses for his minor so being able to share his knowledge and teach others about this topic was incredibly fortuitous. The team was going into BitCamp in order to help Christopher make his first mobile application and impart the knowledge Samantha has onto him before graduating college. The team wanted to make the application a fun and interesting game like the choose your own adventure stories we grew up reading.

## What it does
Our application tests users on their day as well as basic Sustainability principles in order to view their daily habits through the lens of Environmental Studies. Each user starts the quiz at 100 points. By incrementing through a set list of questions with multiple choice responses, Seeing Green will add or deduct points based on how Environmentally Friendly the users daily practices are. The application is also able to keep a score counter and a list of responses made by the user in order to keep a personal leaderboard as well as provide some reasoning and explanations of various topics in Sustainability at the conclusion of the quiz.

## How we built it
We started by using the Ionic platform because of Samantha’s experience with it and the knowledge that this could allow our application to be built for Android, iOS, and most web browsers, from one source code. We then used Ionic to build an Angular application. From there we modified the app.component.ts and app.component.html files in order to display the different screens required to carry out our application. Samantha created/modified the index.ts and user.service.ts files to establish Observables and other useful interfaces. We were able use standard ionic UI components found at [https://ionicframework.com]( https://ionicframework.com/docs/components) to build the application and corresponding Angular functions and variables. We were able to make/view incremental changes to our code by running ionic serve and observing the localhost:8100 on our Google Chrome browsers.

## Challenges we ran into
One challenge the team faced was having to simplify the broad and detail-oriented nature of Sustainability into a few basic questions for the user to understand and respond to in a reasonable amount of time. However, we knew that most people have a basic understanding of Sustainability meaning we could not make the questions too simple as to prevent users from giving the “Best” choice as opposed to the honest one. Making a choose your own adventure feeling application was also difficult as we had to make sure the questions pointed the user to the next appropriate one based on the answer they selected on the previous one.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Christopher is especially proud of being able to find an intersection of his educational passions, Computer Science and Sustainability. Christopher was proud of Seeing Green both because of its potential to educate others and because it was his first ever mobile application. We were also incredibly proud of making the game feel like a choose your adventure story like the ones the team enjoyed as children. Being able to effectively communicate and work together despite being siblings made the team immensely proud, especially Samantha who was excited to be able to pass down some of her knowledge to Christopher at his first ever Hackathon

## What we learned
Samantha was able to get an introduction to the vast world of Sustainability and Christopher was able to learn how to create a mobile application through the use of Angular and Ionic this weekend.

## What's next for Seeing Green
The next steps we plan to implement are the ability to share your results with others and being able to track other people’s scores on the leaderboard so you can compare/compete with your friends. We also want to create a larger pool of questions that users would get a random selection of daily and be able to create more questions that directly lead to others for more of the choose your adventure feeling.
